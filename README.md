# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview  
This project classifies iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains measurements for petal and sepal dimensions.

## Dataset  
The dataset is available in the Scikit-learn library or can be downloaded externally.

## Libraries Used  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the `Iris_Classification.ipynb` file  
3. Run the code cells to train and evaluate the model  

## Results  
- Best model accuracy: **XX%**  
- Confusion matrix and visualizations included

## Future Improvements  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Advanced visualization techniques
